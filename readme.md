## How It Works

  

1.  **User selects insurance type**

2.  **Uploads 2 policy documents**

3.  **Agent extracts clauses and stores them in vector DB**

4.  **User enters needs (e.g., age, illness, car model)**

5.  **LLM compares policies, explains pros/cons, and gives recommendation**

6.  **User interacts via chatbot for queries like:**

- ‚ÄúDoes Policy B cover diabetes?‚Äù

- ‚ÄúWhich one has shorter waiting period?‚Äù
